# Containment Game

## Overview

Containment Game is a non-profit project to play your favorite games directly in your browser with your friends during containment. Because approximately half of the human population is contained into their homes today, we need some way to entertain and keep in touch with friends.

You can find an online running version of the app at [https://www.containment-ga.me](https://app.containment-ga.me).

## Getting started

Okay, so you prefer to run it locally? You’re right, do it for your friends too!  
First things first, install Node.js, yarn and git, and clone the repo.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:containment-game-js/frontend.git containment-game-frontend
```

Make sure [the backend is installed and running](https://github.com/containment-game-js/server), and start the project.

```bash
cd containment-game-frontend
yarn
yarn serve
```

You’re good to go!

## Any idea, improvement?

We love to hear from you! Open an issue, we’re responding as quick as we can!

## About license

Yes, Containment Game frontend is not MIT or BSD licensed, but rather Apache 2.0 + Commons Clause. This is because we don’t own the designs, which are made by a professional designer [Maha El Aoufir](https://www.mahaelaoufir.com/) who allowed us to use it for the project. By respect for her work, we publish it on a non-commercial only license. If you like the design, talk to her directly. She works as a freelance. Moreover, we’re building games who are probably under copyrights in your country. If you like it, buy the game. And if you’re stakeholders and don’t want that your game could be easily accessible here, write to us. We don’t want to make money with the projects, neither we want to spoil someone else work. We will take the game down. So be a good citizen, and don’t use this code to make money.

## Behind the scenes

We’re a team of passionate and devoted people behind the project, for the most of us located in Paris and the others in the rest of France:

- Guillaume Hivert, amazing fullstack and blockchain developer. [ghivert on GitHub](https://github.com/ghivert) and everywhere else. Functional developer, he spend time tweaking CSS classes. Master of Languages-compiling-to-JavaScript and Clojure lover.
- Arthur Escriou, incredible fullstack and DevOps developer. [arthurescriou on GitHub](https://github.com/arthurescriou). He works a lot with servers and likes having dirty hands while talking to AWS directly. Lord of CI/CD and Vue.js lover.
- Maha El Aoufir, awesome designer. [You can find her on her website](https://www.mahaelaoufir.com/). She give birth to your craziest designers dreams. Figma magician and WebFlow overlord.
- Camille Laurent, entrepreneur & beta tester. She helped us finding the good words for CodeNames and tried the software more than anyone else.
- All our friends (Morgane, Louise, Constance, Laura, and others I forget), who kindly supported us testing the software and patiently waiting for our finished work (yes, because you know, I can add this little touch here and there, and… Oooh, I think it could be better like this and…)

If you like our work, send us a love letter, or even better, pay us a beer!
